This is a simple calculator application built using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Buttons for digits 0 to 9 for input
- Buttons for arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
- Buttons for clearing the input and submitting the expression
- Error handling for invalid expressions

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter a mathematical expression using the provided buttons.
3. Click the "E" button to submit the expression and view the result.
4. Use the "C" button to clear the input field if needed.

## Functionality
- The "1" to "9" buttons add their respective digits to the input field.
- The "0" button adds the digit 0 to the input field.
- The "+" button adds the addition operator.
- The "-" button adds the subtraction operator.
- The "*" button adds the multiplication operator.
- The "/" button adds the division operator.
- Clicking the "E" button evaluates the expression and displays the result.
- If the expression is invalid or results in an error during evaluation, an error message is displayed.
- Clicking the "C" button clears the input field.

## Usage Notes
- Ensure that the input expression follows standard mathematical notation.
- Use the buttons provided for input; typing directly into the input field is not supported.
